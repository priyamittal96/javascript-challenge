WAKE UP SHEEPLE! The extra-terrestrial menace has come to Earth and we here at ALIENS-R-REAL have collected all of the eye-witness reports we could to prove it! All we need to do now is put this information online for the world to see and then the matter will finally be put to rest.

There is just one tiny problem thoughâ€¦ our collection is too large to search through manually. Even our most dedicated followers are complaining that they are having trouble locating specific reports in this mess.

## Technologies
Using d3 in javascript, the base index.html is updated with the UFO sightings noted in the data.js file. 

## Level 1 v Level 2
Level 1 initiates the website with only the date filter to be applied on the table of UFO sightings, while Level 2 allows for additional filters of UFO sightings. Each base index.html and .js files are within the respective folders for each of the levels.
